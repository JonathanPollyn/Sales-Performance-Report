# Sales-Performance-Report
## Overview:
Greetings, and thank you for visiting the repository for the Sales Performance Report! This project offers a Sales Performance Report that is both visually appealing and interactive, using Microsoft Power BI. The Report analyzes sales data from the AdventureWorks sample database to provide insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics. 

## Features:
Sales Overview: Obtain a detailed overview of the total sales revenue, the quantity of products sold, and the best products sold. 
Sales by Region: Analyze sales performance across various regions, including total sales, average order value, and growth from one year to the next. 
Product Performance: Dive into technical details at the product level to understand sales performance by category, subcategory, and individual products. 
Analysis of Customers: Investigate the behavior and preferences of customers by using metrics such as demographics, purchase frequency, and lifetime value during the analysis process. 
Time-based analysis allows you to monitor sales progression over time using date filters that can be customized to include daily, monthly, and annual views. When analyzing profitability, it is essential to consider gross profit margins, discounts, and the cost of goods sold by evaluating profitability.
